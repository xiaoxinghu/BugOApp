# 🐞-O Notation

The branch `o(n!)` is the first implementation of the logic.

# Testing

Here are your tasks:
- create a branch off of the `testing` branch, name it after you
- implement `TODO`s
- fix issues of existing tests if any (wink wink)
- maybe adding a couple of tests if you like, to cover issues maybe (wink wink)
